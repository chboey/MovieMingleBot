# üé¨ MovieMingleBot

MovieMingleBot is an Interactive NLP-based AI system designed to manage cinema bookings and provide a seamless user experience. This bot can handle various queries related to screening times, booking or cancelling tickets, checking the time or weather, and engaging in small talk.

## Introduction
My approach to an Interactive NLP-based AI system revolves around a cinema booking system, called ‚ÄòMovieMingleBot‚Äô. This system demonstrates methodologies of cosine-similarity and TF-IDF Vectorization for information retrieval, question answering, and intent matching. The chatbot is capable of handling various types of inquiries, enhancing the user experience with clear elements of Conversational Design.

## Installation
To get started with MovieMingleBot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MovieMingleBot.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd MovieMingleBot
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the bot**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage
Once the bot is running, you can interact with it via the command line. Below are some example interactions:

- **Greeting the bot**
    ```plaintext
    User: Hello!
    Bot: Hi there! How can I assist you today?
    ```

- **Booking a movie ticket**
