# üé¨ MovieMingleBot

MovieMingleBot is an Interactive NLP-based AI system designed to manage cinema bookings and provide a seamless user experience. This bot can handle various queries related to screening times, booking or cancelling tickets, checking the time or weather, and engaging in small talk.

## Introduction
My approach to an Interactive NLP-based AI system revolves around a cinema booking system, called ‚ÄòMovieMingleBot‚Äô. This system demonstrates methodologies of cosine-similarity and TF-IDF Vectorization for information retrieval, question answering, and intent matching. The chatbot is capable of handling various types of inquiries, enhancing the user experience with clear elements of Conversational Design.
